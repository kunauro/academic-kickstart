abstract = "Many models have been recently developed for the optimization of biomass related supply chains. However, models for biopower supply chains powered by animal waste have not received much attention yet. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for supplier selection and procurement planning for a biopower plant. The model integrates time window constraints for the collection of animal waste as well as inventory constraints. We show that the model is intractable with a state-of-the art commercial solver and propose a heuristic approach based on the Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) framework. We show the efficiency of this approach on a case study in central France."
